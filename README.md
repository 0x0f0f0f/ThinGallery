A single-file gallery webpage. This uses EXIF thumbnails, XMLHttpRequest Range headers, 
and your web server's own index pages to quickly display thumbnails for a directory without
having to fully load every image file, and without needing ANY server-side scripting.

Usage
-----

* Put `gallery.html` in the folder that contains your photos. 
* Don't rename it to `index.html` as the web server's own index.html is required in order to list the photos
* Open gallery.html with a web browser, and enjoy
